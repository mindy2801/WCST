1 to 128 = deck choice (from left to right, 0 = empty trial)
	min 110 to max 128
129 to 256 = correct or not (1 or 0, -1 to be ignored)
257 ~ = other information

r = c(0, 1) #Reward feedback
p = c(0, 1) #Punished feedback
d = c(0.01, 5) #Decision consistency
i = c(0.01, 5) #Attentional focus

Model Names:
deckbase: no free parameter. Always .25 probability of choosing each deck
catt33: another baseline model. Constant .33 attention to each dimension.

*Sobol sequence:
low discrepancy sequence
	Discrepancy? 
Low-discrepancy sequences, also known as “quasirandom” sequences, are numbers that are better equidistributed in a given volume than pseudo-random numbers. 

*Stretching and contracting parameters: Why is it necessary?
*Scaling parameters 3 to 2 or 2 to 3: why is it necessary?
*optim function: optimization process? What to optimize?
